Use GitHup to host a web site to host the HTML <b>Writeup</b> created in RStudio using Knitr.

## Goal

The goal of your project is to predict the manner in which people exercise. 
This is the <b>"classe"</b> variable in the training set.

You may use any of the other variables to predict with. 
You should create a report describing how you built your model, 
how you used cross validation, what you think the expected out of sample error is, 
and why you made the choices you did.
<p/>
You will also use your prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.
